                        Once the training process of all machine learning models for all proteins was completed, the question arose of whether a consensus strategy could improve the performance of the machine learning models.

                        Develop consensus classification models based on two strategies: the first using only the top five models of each protein, and the second considering all machine learning models but applying a weighted prediction, where models with lower performance receive a smaller weight compared to the others.

            <p class="raw-text">
                The machine learning models with the best hyperparameters were saved using the <b>joblib</b> library for Python. Additionally, a <b>DataFrame</b> was created to store these models along with their performance, for use in the weighted prediction consensus model.

            <p class="raw-text">
                The <strong>consensus model</strong> is developed by first selecting the <strong>5 best-performing models</strong> for each protein and loading the corresponding <strong>test data for the three descriptor types</strong> to ensure consistent predictions. Each of the 5 models then generates <strong>probabilities of being "active"</strong> using exactly the same test data. For each sample, the <strong>average probability</strong> across the 5 models is calculated, and if this average is â‰¥ 0.5, the sample is classified as <strong>active</strong>; otherwise, it is classified as <strong>inactive</strong>. This approach <strong>leverages multiple models</strong> to improve prediction reliability while ensuring that the <strong>same test data</strong> is used for all models, regardless of the descriptor type.
            </p>

            <p class="raw-text">
                The <strong>consensus model evaluation</strong> was performed in the same way as the individual models, since it now produces only a <strong>list of predictions with 0 and 1</strong> (inactive and active). The corresponding <strong>Scikit-learn libraries</strong> were used to assess the model using the <strong>same metrics</strong> as those applied to the individual models.

                  For the <strong>weighted model</strong>, all <strong>15 machine learning models</strong> were considered. Instead of a simple average, a <strong>weighted average</strong> was computed, where each prediction was multiplied by its corresponding weight, and the sum of all provided the final model output. Similarly, if the result was â‰¥ 0.5, it was classified as <strong>1 (active)</strong>; otherwise, as <strong>0 (inactive)</strong>. Since these are now <strong>simple classifications</strong>, <strong>Scikit-learn</strong> was also used to evaluate the model's performance using standard metrics.

            <p class="raw-text">
                 As shown in the previous figure, the results of the <strong>best original individual models</strong> outperformed the <strong>consensus models</strong>. This is expected and has been discussed in multiple studies and articles. The book <strong>Introduction to Machine Learning with Python</strong> explains that the only consensus models that are consistently effective are those involving <strong>decision tree ensembles</strong>, such as <strong>Random Forest</strong> and <strong>gradient boosting</strong>.

            <li>The project explored whether a <strong>consensus strategy</strong> could improve the performance of machine learning models trained for each protein.</li>
            <li>Two consensus strategies were implemented: <strong>top-5 model average</strong> and <strong>weighted average of all 15 models</strong> based on individual model performance.</li>
            <li>Machine learning models with optimized hyperparameters were saved using <strong>joblib</strong>, and a <strong>DataFrame</strong> was created to track models and their performance for weighted predictions.</li>
            <li>The <strong>top-5 consensus model</strong> calculates probabilities of being active from the 5 best models, averages them, and classifies samples as active if the average â‰¥ 0.5, otherwise inactive.</li>
            <li>The <strong>weighted consensus model</strong> considers all 15 models, multiplies each prediction by its weight, sums them, and classifies based on a 0.5 threshold.</li>
            <li>Both consensus models were evaluated using <strong>Scikit-learn metrics</strong> in the same way as individual models.</li>
            <li>Results showed that the <strong>best original individual models outperformed the consensus models</strong>, which is consistent with observations in literature.</li>
            <li>The book <strong>Introduction to Machine Learning with Python</strong> notes that only consensus models using <strong>decision tree ensembles</strong> (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) are consistently effective.</li>
