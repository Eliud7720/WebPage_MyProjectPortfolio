                The databases <strong>COCONUT</strong> and <strong>ReframeDB</strong> were downloaded in CSV format, containing nearly <strong>700,000 compounds</strong> in total for prediction. These files were loaded into Python as pandas DataFrames and then merged into a single table named <strong>‚Äúcombined bases‚Äù</strong>, which includes only three columns: <strong>Identifier</strong>, <strong>SMILES</strong>, and <strong>Compound Name</strong>.

                Data Processing
            </h3>

            <p class="raw-text">
                After merging the databases, the Python library <strong>RDKit</strong> was used to <strong>remove salts and ions</strong> from all compounds. Additionally, compounds already present in the datasets were excluded. Compounds with <strong>missing SMILES</strong> were also removed, while those with missing names were retained since most compounds do not have a name until they are patented. Finally, compounds with <strong>duplicate identifiers</strong> or <strong>duplicate SMILES</strong> were eliminated.

            <p class="raw-text">
                Once the data was processed, the <strong>ECFP4 molecular fingerprint</strong> was calculated for all compounds, since it is the one used in the best models for each protein. With this information, the probability of belonging to <strong>class 1 (active)</strong> was predicted for every compound across the 4 proteins, resulting in a total of <strong>2,800,000 predictions</strong>

                As seen in the previous figures, a large number of compounds have a probability of <strong>0.9 or higher</strong> of inhibiting <strong>EGFR</strong> and <strong>MAPK1</strong>. However, only <strong>107 compounds</strong> and <strong>1,450 compounds</strong> have a probability ‚â•0.9 of inhibiting <strong>SRC</strong> and <strong>STAT3</strong>, respectively. Therefore, we can anticipate that the majority of the results will consist of <strong>multi-target compounds between EGFR and MAPK1</strong>.

            </h3>

            <p class="raw-text">
                Since the goal is to identify compounds with a <strong>high probability of inhibiting at least two proteins (multi-target compounds)</strong>, the <strong>pandas</strong> library in Python was used to analyze and determine the shared compounds. The strategy for analyzing shared compounds is illustrated in the following diagram:

                A final filtering step was performed to ensure the compounds are <strong>orally bioavailable in humans</strong>. All compounds were filtered using the <strong>Lipinski‚Äôs rules</strong>, retaining only those with a maximum of <strong>one violation</strong>.

                As a result, <strong>594 promising compounds</strong> were identified for the proteins shown in the previous table. The analyses presented on this page cover up to this point. However, <strong>25% of the project remains</strong>, including <strong>molecular docking</strong> and <strong>molecular interaction analysis</strong>. Additionally, <strong>potential toxicity, costs, and other factors</strong> will be evaluated, ultimately leading to <strong>4 highly promising compounds</strong>.
