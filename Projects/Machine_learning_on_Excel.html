                        Dementia, primarily <strong>Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)</strong>, is one of the leading causes of <strong>disability and mortality</strong> in older adults, affecting <strong>1.3 million people in Mexico</strong>. <strong>Type 2 diabetes (T2D)</strong> increases the risk of developing AD by 1.5 to 2 times and is associated with <strong>cerebral insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress</strong>. <strong>Antidiabetic drugs</strong> have shown cognitive improvements in patients with AD or Mild Cognitive Impairment. To date, no <strong>specific inhibitors</strong> targeting proteins involved in the AD-T2D interaction have been identified. Advances in <strong>artificial intelligence and machine learning</strong> provide tools to discover new inhibitors with high precision and efficiency, optimizing drug development. Therefore, employing machine learning models could enable the identification of <strong>potential inhibitors for the AD-T2D association</strong> with high accuracy, improve their selection, and reduce the costs associated with drug development. A study identified a total of <strong>10 proteins linking AD with T2D</strong>, with <strong>EGFR, MAPK1, SRC, and STAT3</strong> being the most prominent. Given the large number of assays reporting <strong>IC50 values</strong>, machine learning models can be trained to predict IC50 activity for each protein.

            Experimental data on inhibition was collected from the ChEMBL web chemolibrary for the proteins <strong>EGFR</strong>, <strong>MAPK1</strong>, <strong>SRC</strong>, and <strong>STAT3</strong>, which have IDs <strong>CHEMBL203</strong>, <strong>CHEMBL4040</strong>, <strong>CHEMBL267</strong>, and <strong>CHEMBL4026</strong> in CSV format. Each file was loaded as a <strong>pandas dataframe</strong> in Python. The compound data for each file consisted of <strong>47 columns</strong> describing each assay of a specific compound against the protein, with columns including information such as the <strong>compound name</strong>, <strong>SMILES</strong> (a way to represent chemical compounds in cheminformatics), and <strong>IC50 assay results</strong>. Only the following columns were selected: <strong>"Molecule ChEMBL ID"</strong>, <strong>"Molecule Name"</strong>, <strong>"Smiles"</strong>, <strong>"Standard Type"</strong>, <strong>"Standard Relation"</strong>, <strong>"Standard Value"</strong>, <strong>"Standard Units"</strong>, <strong>"Assay Type"</strong>, <strong>"Molecular Weight"</strong>, <strong>"BAO Label"</strong>, <strong>"Action Type"</strong>.

            <p>As seen in the previous graph, the first four columns represent unique compounds for each protein, while the rest represent shared compounds.

            <li>The preprocessing of ChEMBL data for EGFR, MAPK1, SRC, and STAT3 reduced the number of compounds significantly, ensuring cleaner datasets for machine learning models.</li>
            <li>Missing data was carefully handled: rows with missing values in key experimental results were removed, while columns like <strong>Molecule Name</strong> and <strong>Molecular Weight</strong> were preserved when possible.</li>
            <li>Unit inconsistencies in <strong>Standard Units</strong> were standardized, ensuring assay results are comparable across proteins.</li>
            <li>Only reliable assays were retained by filtering for exact values (“=”) and excluding censored data (">", "<").</li>
            <li>Duplicates were removed to avoid bias, and only protein binding assays and single protein formats were conserved.</li>
            <li>A binary classification column (<strong>Active vs. Inactive</strong>) was created using an IC50 threshold of 1000 nM, enabling supervised learning approaches.</li>
            <li>Most datasets showed class imbalances below 40%, which is manageable for machine learning algorithms with proper handling.</li>
            <li>Shared compound analysis revealed overlaps among proteins (e.g., 392 compounds shared between SRC and EGFR), highlighting potential multitarget inhibitors.</li>
            <li>These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using machine learning to predict IC50 values and discover new compounds that could inhibit multiple proteins related to Alzheimer’s Disease and Type 2 Diabetes.</li>
