                    <p class="raw-text">After the drug discovery phase (the stage in which the researcher determines compounds that inhibit or potentially inhibit the protein of interest), an <strong>in silico prediction</strong> is carried out to predict potential toxicity in order to perform another screening and only retain molecules that potentially do not have toxic effects on humans.</p>

                    <p class="raw-text"><strong>ProTox</strong> is a website that includes a wide variety of machine learning tools to predict the toxicity of various aspects; however, it only allows the toxicity of a single molecule to be calculated at a time.</p>

                    <p class="raw-text">Therefore, for this project, I was hired to develop a <strong>script</strong> that would allow ProTox to automatically work with a set of molecules and carry out predictions.</p>

            </h3>

            <p class="raw-text"><strong>ProTox</strong> is an online platform that provides a variety of <strong>machine learning tools</strong> to predict the potential <strong>toxicity</strong> of chemical compounds. It helps researchers assess whether molecules might have harmful effects on humans. However, the standard ProTox interface only allows predictions for one molecule at a time, which can be limiting for large datasets.</p>
            <p class="raw-text"> 
            The following screenshots show the <strong>ProTox page</strong>, specifically the section where all stages of the prediction process are configured. Here, the <em>SMILES</em> of the compound of interest is entered, and all relevant prediction options are selected for analysis.
            </p>

                Script Development
            </h3>

            <p class="raw-text">
            Due to the intensive work required to analyze, for example, 60 molecules manually and compile all the results into a single DataFrame, I developed a script that automatically reads data from CSV files, performs the predictions on the ProTox website, and finally combines all results into a single CSV file.
            </p>

            <p class="raw-text">
            For the development of this script, the <strong>Python Selenium library</strong> was used, along with <strong>pandas</strong> and <strong>numpy</strong> to work with <strong>DataFrames</strong>. The script is designed to load a <strong>CSV file</strong> that contains a column named <strong>SMILES</strong> with the compounds' SMILES strings. It then automatically opens the <strong>Mozilla browser</strong>, inputs each SMILES, selects all the required prediction options, and finally saves all the results into a single <strong>CSV file</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="raw-text">
            The following video demonstrates the functionality of the script. It shows how the script automatically enters the <strong>SMILES</strong> strings, clicks all the required buttons, and ultimately retrieves the prediction results.

                Example of use
            </h3>

            <p class="raw-text">
            This script has been used countless times. In my case, I analyzed up to <strong>200 different compounds</strong> to determine their potential <strong>polypharmacological activity</strong>‚Äîthat is, whether a compound could inhibit more than one protein, which is undesirable in drug design as it indicates potential side effects and toxicological risks.
            </p>

            <p class="raw-text">
            After obtaining the results in the format shown previously, I loaded the data using <strong>pandas</strong> in Python and created a new column representing the <strong>number of proteins potentially inhibited by each compound</strong>. I then grouped all compounds by the number of proteins they inhibited and identified the specific proteins for compounds inhibiting 1, 2, and more proteins. Finally, I generated a <strong>histogram</strong> showing these distributions. 
            </p>

            <p class="raw-text">
            Additionally, for each group, I identified the <strong>maximum common substructure</strong> among the compounds, which is displayed at the top of the following histogram.
            </p>

            <img src="projects_images\Protox_webScrapping\Histogram_example.png" alt="Protox_2" class="raw-image">

            <p class="raw-text">
            As shown in the previous histogram, the vast majority of compounds exhibited only <strong>1 to 2 proteins</strong> as polypharmacological activity. The top section shows that molecules with this low activity were similar to <strong>staurosporine</strong> and other <strong>heterocyclic molecules</strong>. However, at least two heterocyclic molecules showed potential activity against <strong>5 or more proteins</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="raw-text">
            The proteins potentially inhibited are displayed at the top, and the <strong>‚Äú+‚Äù sign</strong> indicates that the compound inhibits this protein in addition to the previous ones, showing a trend where certain compounds inhibited the same proteins while also affecting additional ones.
