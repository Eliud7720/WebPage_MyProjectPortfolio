                        Autism is a lifelong <strong>neurodevelopmental condition</strong> that primarily affects how individuals perceive the world, process information, communicate, and interact with others. 
                        According to the DSM-5, autism is classified into <strong>three levels</strong> based on the amount of support a person requires. 
                        Numerous studies have highlighted significant differences in the <strong>gut microbiota</strong> between individuals with autism and neurotypical controls. 
                        However, <strong>the oral microbiota has been far less explored</strong> in this context. 
                        To address this gap, a study was conducted analyzing the oral microbiota of <strong>60 participants</strong>, including patients across different levels of autism and neurotypical individuals. 
                        The dataset consisted of the bacterial species counts for each participant, which now require <strong>statistical analysis</strong> to derive meaningful conclusions.

                The dataset used for this <strong>statistical and data analysis</strong> was provided by the requester in the format shown in the following figure. 
                In this structure, each <strong>column represents a sample</strong>, while each <strong>cell corresponds to the count of a bacterial species</strong> for a given patient.

            <p class="raw-text">
                The <strong>data analysis and statistical procedures</strong> were performed using <strong>R</strong>. 
                First, the total number of <strong>unique species</strong> in the dataset was counted, resulting in <strong>1,859 species</strong>. 
                Next, species that were absent across all patients were filtered out. 
                This was done by summing across rows to determine the total abundance of each species in all samples. 
                If the total sum for a species was zero, it would be discarded; however, in this case, every species had at least one occurrence. 
                This step is necessary because, given how the dataset was generated and summarized, it may include species from external sources not actually present in the study samples.
            </p>


            <p class="raw-text">
                The <strong>most prevalent species</strong> were identified, meaning those that were present in <strong>all 60 participants</strong>.

            Subsequently, using <strong>R</strong>, the table was <strong>transposed</strong> so that the columns represented the <strong>bacterial species</strong>. 
            A <strong>LEFT JOIN</strong> was then performed with another table to associate each sample with its corresponding group. 
            Next, the data were <strong>grouped by category</strong> (levels 1, 2, 3, and controls), and the <strong>median abundance of each species</strong> was calculated for each group. 
            Finally, the table was <strong>transposed again</strong> to display the data vertically, with <strong>columns representing the groups</strong> and <strong>rows corresponding to the species</strong>.

                Although these data now allow us to compare <strong>group medians</strong>, this alone is not sufficient to determine whether there are <strong>statistically significant differences</strong> between groups. 
                To assess this, a <strong>statistical test</strong> such as <strong>ANOVA</strong> is required. 
                However, before applying ANOVA, it is necessary to determine the <strong>distribution type</strong> of each variable. 
                To this end, the <strong>Shapiro-Wilk test</strong> was performed in <strong>R</strong> to assess whether the data for each species follow a <strong>normal distribution</strong>. 
                The Shapiro-Wilk test uses the <strong>null hypothesis</strong> that the data come from a normal distribution. 
                If the resulting <strong>p-value</strong> is less than or equal to 0.05, there is a low probability that the data follow a normal distribution, and the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating a <strong>non-parametric distribution</strong>. 
                Conversely, if the p-value is greater than 0.05, there is a reasonable probability that the data follow a <strong>normal distribution</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="raw-text">
                The <strong>Shapiro-Wilk test</strong> was calculated for the data of all species across all samples. 
                The overall results are presented in the <strong>following table</strong>.

            <p class="raw-text">
                Since all species followed a <strong>non-normal distribution</strong> and there are <strong>four independent groups</strong>, the most appropriate test to determine <strong>differences between groups</strong> in this case is the <strong>Kruskal-Wallis test</strong>.

            The <strong>Kruskal-Wallis test</strong> was conducted to determine whether at least one of the groups exhibited a <strong>different distribution</strong> for each bacterial species. 
            This analysis was performed using <strong>R</strong>, and the results were saved as a <strong>CSV file</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="raw-text">
                A total of <strong>125 species</strong> were identified with a <strong>p-value less than 0.05</strong>, indicating a high probability that at least one of the groups exhibits a <strong>unequal distribution</strong> for each species. 
                Additionally, a metric called <strong>difference</strong> was calculated for each species, measuring the disparity between the group with the <strong>highest mean abundance</strong> and the group with the <strong>lowest mean abundance</strong> to assess the practical significance of these differences. 
                This step was necessary because, among the 125 species, many showed <strong>statistically significant but minor differences</strong> (e.g., median differences of 5 or 10), which, although statistically significant, are not practically relevant in this context.
